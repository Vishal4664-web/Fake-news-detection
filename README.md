# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning:

📌 Project Overview:

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using machine learning techniques. With the rapid spread of misinformation, automating fake news detection has become crucial. The model classifies news as Fake or Real based on the text content.# Fake-news-detection
Detect the news is fake or real

⚙️ Features:

Preprocessing of news dataset (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).
Text vectorization using TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer.
Machine Learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interactive prediction script for testing custom news.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
NLTK / SpaCy (for NLP preprocessing)

📂Dataset:

Public datasets such as Fake News Dataset from Kaggle.
Contains labeled news articles as Fake or Real.

📌 Future Improvements:

Use Deep Learning (LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy.
Real-time web scraping & detection system.
Multilingual fake news detection
